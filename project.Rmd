Research Question for Dataset 1 (Colleges): Is there any correlation between 
mid-career salary and the percentage of of alumni who think they are making the 
world a better place across all North Carolina colleges? 
Hypothesis for Dataset 1: There will be no correlation between mid-career salary
and the percentage of alumni who believe they are making the world a better 
place across North Carolina colleges. 

Research Question for Dataset 2 (Transit): Is the cost per km of urban rail 
more dependent on the time length of the project or the total rail length 
of the project? 
Hypothesis for Dataset 2: Cost per km of urban rail is more dependent on the 
total rail length of the project. 

Research Question for Dataset 3 (Spotify): For music tracks 
(tracks with a speechiness < 0.33), what is the correlation between 
energy and popularity? What is the mean energy for tracks that go #1? 
Hypothesis for Dataset 3: Songs with higher energy scores (> 0.8) are more 
likely to be more popular (< 25) than songs with low energy scores (0.2). 
The mean energy for tracks that go #1 is 0.8 or greater.
